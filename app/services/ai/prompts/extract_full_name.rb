          A user provided us with unstructured data for their first and last name. We need to break it into first_name and last_name parts to use in our email list system.

          1. Break the provided info into first_name and last_name parts. The first name should be something that would fit nicely into the following template: "Hi firstName!"

          2. Transform the parts into "nice" data. For example, transform "ZACH latta" into first_name: "Zach", last_name: "Latta"

          3. If the user has a preferred name, use that because they are the recipient of the emails we're sending and we want to respect their preferences

          4. Ensure that first_name + last_name contains the full name the user provided us (ex. some last names have multiple words in them)

          User provided info:

          #{raw_input}
        PROMPT
      end

      # Schema definition - defines the structure of the response
      class Schema < RubyLLM::Schema
        strict false
        string :firstName, description: "The person's first name"
        string :lastName, description: "The person's last name"
      end
    end
  end
